# LiftLog
LiftLog is an Android application that I created for Fullstack Academy's Stackathon using React-Native in just a couple days!

One of my favorite hobbies is weightlifting, and I have been using a basic spreadsheet to track my workouts for as long as I can remember. I'm currently using a variation of
5/3/1 for my compound lifts, and workout on a general Push/Pull/Legs/Rest schedule.

The idea was to create a mobile application that I can use to take the place of the spreadsheet as a fun exercise to learn how to use React-Native. While simple, I was able
to implement all of the features that my spreadsheet was already providing me, but in a more "mobile-friendly" format!
